Compute direction of selection (DoS) per gene, and perform correlations.

1. Edit and run mk_alpha_per_gene.R to get DoS for each population.
2. Run compare_pop_mk.R to compare DoS between populations.
3. Run combime_pop_mk.R to compute average DoS across all 4 populations
4. Run correlate_DoS_combined_avg_kvsknonsig_plotDoSMean.R to correlate gene-wise DoS with the ancestral relax K.
5. Run correlate_DoS_combined_avg_CodemlvsCodemlnonsig_plotDoSMean.R to correlate gene-wise DoS with the ancestral positive selection.
