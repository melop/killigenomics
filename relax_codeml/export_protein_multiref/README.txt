Export coding sequence alignments, given reference genomes and the resequenced species mapped to them. 

1. refs.txt defines reference genomes and their associated gff3 gene annotations.
2. genomes.txt defines the resequenced bam files and the reference species they are mapped to.
3. The ortholog information file orthologs.improved.txt was generated by the UPhO pipeline.
4. Run export.sbatch on SLURM to export protein-coding alignments, output in out/. During this process TranslatorX and GBlocks are called to sanitize the alignments.
5. Run sumresults.sh to summarize the exported alignments into one fasta file named ret_improved_cleanDNA.fasta
6. Make a monophyly_desc.txt file, to specify what are the monophyletic groupings to be included in the constraint tree.
	The format of this file is Clade_Name	[TAB]	TAXON1,TAXON2,*Clade1,TAXON3 ... [RETURN]
	The comma separated list gives the terminal taxa to be included in the clade, or you can specify a previously defined clade prefixed with an asteriks *.
7. Run monophyly_test.sbatch to conduct a constraint and unconstraint search using RAxML for each gene tree. An approximately unbiased test (AU test) is used to check if the unconstraint tree significantly reject the constraint tree. Output files in genetrees_improved/. Format is GeneId[Tab] Taxa Count [Tab] Monophyly accepted [Tab] Delta Liklihood [Tab] P value [Tab] Unconstraint tree [Tab] Constraint tree.
8. Run labelbranches.all.sh to label the foreground and background branches for RELAX and Codeml tests. Output into Codeml_*/ and Relax_*/ folders. The Folders suffixed with "mrca" has only the ancestral branches marked.
9. Optionally, run labelbranches.foregroundChildrenExcluded.all.sh to label the ancestral branch of a target clade as the foreground, AND exclude all of the children clades. output into Relax_*_childrenexcl/.
