Build a mt tree from synonymous sites.

1. Run do.sh to re-estimate branch lengths using synonymous sites and the topology inferred in ../raxml/.
2. Use plotBranchLen.R to plot the branch lengths of Callopanchax vs. Scriptaphyosemion, and Nothobranchius vs. Aphyosemion (excluding semi-annuals A. kunzi).
3. Proceed to clocktest to test for deviation from local molecular clocks.
